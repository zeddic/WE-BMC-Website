  <h1>Western Engineering Biomedical Club (WE BMC)</h1>
  <p>The Biomedical Engineering Club (BMC) brings together students in various disciplines and allows them to pursue their interest in biomedical applications. This club collaborates with graduate students to show undergraduate students potential research possibilities through the university. Potential events will include guest speakers, biomedical competition, industry spotlights, meetings and skills labs. In addition, professors and graduate students will share their past experiences and their paths on how they decided on a career in biomedical engineering.
  <br> <br> The purpose of the BMC is to create awareness for biomedical engineering and to complement the new biomedical concurrent degree being introduced in September 2019. Western has a very strong master's program and world-renowned researchers in biomedical engineering. It is now time to bring this to the undergraduate level.</p>
