				<p>WE BMC (Western Engineering Biomedical Club) is a student-run club whose mandate is to promote biomedical engineering at the undergraduate level. Recently founded in 2018 by four undergraduate students with a shared passion for biomedical engineering. WE BMC is growing in members every year! </p>

				<h1>Our Purpose</h1>

				<p>The purpose of the WE BMC is to create awareness of the opportunities in biomedical engineering and to complement the new biomedical concurrent degree at Western that was introduced in September 2019. Western has a very strong master's program and world-renowned researchers in biomedical engineering. It is now time to bring this to the undergraduate level.</p>
		
				<p>For more information on the biomedical concurrent degree click <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.eng.uwo.ca/biomed/undergraduate/index.html"> here.</a> </p>

				<h1> What We Do </h1>

				<p>We collaborate with graduate students, professors and industry leaders to show undergraduate students various possibilites within biomedical engineering. </p>
